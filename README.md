# SweatMeter

CPU/RAM/GPU/VRAM/thermal/power telemetry and static machine profiling; degrades honestly to Unsupported rather than fabricating a value.

**Status:** specified, not yet implemented. This repository currently holds the project scaffold
(directory structure, tooling configuration, and a local copy of the relevant suite documentation) —
see [development plan](docs/packages/sweatmeter/development-plan.md) for what each phase adds.

Part of the **Local AI Suite** — see [docs/architecture/executive-summary.md](docs/architecture/executive-summary.md)
for how SweatMeter fits with the suite's other applications and packages.

## Install

```bash
pip install sweatmeter
```

## Quickstart

```python
import sweatmeter
```

See [docs/packages/sweatmeter/spec.md](docs/packages/sweatmeter/spec.md) §20 for a runnable example.

## Documentation

This repository carries its own copy of the relevant suite documentation under [`docs/`](docs/README.md),
so it can be read and implemented independently of the other eight suite repositories. Start with
[`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md).
